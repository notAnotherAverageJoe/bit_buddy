        <h3>What is Blockchain?</h3>
        <p>
            Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that 
            records transactions across multiple computers in a way that is 
            <strong>secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant.</strong> 
            Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions,
             and each block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain of blocks.

            Block height refers to the number of bcific block. 
            It essentially indicates the position of a block within the blockchain.

            Each block in a blockchain contains a 
            reference to the hash of the previous block,
            which forms a chain of blocks. The block height of 
            the genesis block (the first block in the blockchain) is typically zero, 
            and subsequent blocks are numbered sequentially from there.

            Block height serves several important purposes in a blockchain system:

            <strong>Sequential Ordering:</strong> It provides a way to organize and track the 
            chronological order of blocks in the blockchain.
            New blocks are added to the blockchain with increasing block heights, ensuring
             that transactions are processed in the correct sequence.
            <strong>Security:</strong> Block height is used in consensus algorithms to 
            validate the longest chain of blocks. In proof-of-work (PoW) 
            blockchains like Bitcoin, the longest valid chain with the highest cumulative 
            proof-of-work is considered the authoritative chain. Block height helps nodes reach 
            consensus on the current state of the blockchain.
            <strong>Difficulty Adjustment:</strong> Some blockchain networks adjust the
            difficulty of mining new blocks based on block height.
            For example, Bitcoin adjusts its mining difficulty every 2016 blocks to maintain an 
            average block creation time of approximately 10 minutes.
            In summary, block height is a fundamental concept in blockchain 
            technology that provides a way to organize, validate, and secure the transactions
             recorded in the blockchain.

            <h3>What is The Timestamp?</h3>
            <p>
                "Time" refers to the timestamp associated with a specific block. 
                This timestamp represents the exact moment when the block was created or mined.
   
               The <strong>timestamp</strong> is typically recorded in Unix time format,
               which is a system for tracking time as a number of seconds since the Unix epoch 
               (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC).
               This timestamp is crucial for maintaining the chronological order of blocks in the blockchain 
               and for verifying the validity of transactions. It helps ensure that transactions are 
               processed in the correct sequence and prevents double-spending of cryptocurrency.

        <h3>Benefits of Blockchain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Blockchain provides transparency as all transactions are recorded and visible to all participants in the network.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that transactions are secure and tamper-proof.</li>
            <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> Blockchain operates without a central authority, making it resistant to censorship and single points of failure.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Blockchain streamlines processes by eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the time and cost of transactions.</li>
