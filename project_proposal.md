## Get Started

|            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Fill in |
| The focus of this project will be a website that will teach people who are curious about cryptocurrency some of the fundementals. The goal is to remove the sense of con artistry that is associated with the crypto field. I aim to provide a place that shows off the validity and value of decentralized currencies. I will focus mainly on bitcoin and the blockchain, although I had considered more currencies, the reality is bitcoin is the most well known and largest coin and therefore has the most transparency and a strong history.| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Tech Stack | What tech stack will you use for your final project? It is recommended to use the following technologies in this project: Python/Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, Jinja, RESTful APIs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Depending on your idea, you might end up using WTForms and other technologies discussed in the course.                               |         |
| Type       | Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?                                                                                  this will be a website where information is accessed through an api and stored into a SQLAlchemy db. For this project I will use python, postgresql, sqlalchemy, jina, API's JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and flask.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |         |
| Goal       | What goal will your project be designed to achieve?                                                                              The goal is to introduce people to the crypto market by removing the veil of shadiness and shining a light at what crypto actually entails. once that is done the hope is to bring more people into the crypto space with confidence in themselves and possibly lead to investing in a decentralized currency. Once I have shown the validity of crypto I wikk show case the benefits it could bring them to if they entered the space as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |         |
| Users      | What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of your users?                                                                                 
I expect to see most people between the ages of 18-35. Although many people have curriosities about crypto generally it is younger people who are intrigued by it and try to gain more knowledge to understand it.                                                                                                                                                                          |         |
| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. |         |
I will use data from coin market cap for my cryptocurrency data such  as up to date prices for bitcoin and newest blockchain information. 
If I also need to create my own api, i will make it a Portfolio Management API, which will be used to house the information of mock buying selling and staking bitcoins at market rates.

# Breaking down your project

When planning your project, break down your project into smaller tasks, knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later. Some common tasks might include:

- Determining the database schema
- Sourcing your data
- Determining user flow(s)
- Setting up the backend and database
- Setting up the frontend
- What functionality will your app include?
  - User login and sign up
  - Uploading a user profile picture

Here are a few examples to get you started with. During the proposal stage, you just need to create the tasks. Description and details can be edited at a later time. In addition, more tasks can be added in at a later time.

| Task Name |      Schema creation for DB

## Labeling

Labeling is a great way to separate out your tasks and to track progress. Here’s an [example](https://github.com/hatchways/sb-capstone-example/issues) of a list of issues that have labels associated.

| Label Type - schema - documentation    
| Description   draw out my schema and ensure it does all i need it to.                                                                                                                 

| Label Type - Flow and layout - documentation    
| Description   create the best possible experience with a balance of good information and proper layout.                                                                                                             

| Label Type - backend - medium
| Description   create the database I need and ensure my data comes through the api.                                                                                                      

| Label Type - frontend -medium   
| Description  Decide on color schemes and flow/ function of my frontend.


| Label Type - fullstack - authentication for user model
| Description   Ensure the privacy of all users on the site, this is particularly important since, the purpose of this site is to show the trustworthiness of crypto and having information leaks here would only solidify the belief that crypto is a scam.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Difficulty    | Estimating the difficulty level will be helpful to determine if the project is unique and ready to be showcased as part of your portfolio - having a mix of task difficultlies will be essential.                                                                                                                               | Easy, Medium, Hard           |
| Type          | If a frontend/backend task is large at scale (for example: more than 100 additional lines or changes), it might be a good idea to separate these tasks out into their own individual task. If a feature is smaller at scale (not more than 10 files changed), labeling it as fullstack would be suitable to review all at once. | Frontend, Backend, Fullstack |
| Stretch Goals | You can also label certain tasks as stretch goals - as a nice to have, but not mandatory for completing this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Goal      implement a small mini game to break the code simulating what miners do to help keep the blockchain secure.
Goal      create block for each buy and sell transaction




| Must Have, the ability to buy and sell bitcoin, and have a way to create simulated blockchain blocks to simulate what happens when transactions take place.
